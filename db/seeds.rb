# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# For the purpose of creating data later - this is the format.
# Person.create(first_name:"Steve", last_name:"Stevenson", age: 31, hair_color:"Blond", eye_color: "Blue", gender: "male", alive: (19880324))
